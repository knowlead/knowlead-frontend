# knowlead-frontend
So basically this is the frontend of knowlead app, which was made using EXPO as a framework and plataform for React Native , it contains the concept screens of how the user could use the tools (pretty basic ngl).

This was made for an undergraduate thesis and it's the first time i enter in contact with Node.js and React Native, so a lot of things will not be well coded but overall i really enjoyed the experience of coding it.
By the way, most of the screens are in Portuguese since i'm from Brazil, bc of it my english is not perfect overall (as you can see).
This was made in collaboration and help of my teacher and friends from my school, so i really appreaciate all that help, you guys are awesome!
Also, feel free to fork it and submit a pull request :)

## How do i install it?

As i said before, it was made in React Native so install it using the [React Native Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup), a lot of things will not work of course because it will need the backend and database in order to run (since front and backend aren't decoupled), and the adressses are blank (it's written as IP:Port), if you wanna see the screens just remove these parts that has connection with the backend.
